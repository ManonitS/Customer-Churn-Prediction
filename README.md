# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Overview

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. This can significantly impact revenue, making it crucial for businesses to understand why customers are leaving and to develop strategies to retain them.

By using data and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of churning and take proactive steps to retain them before they leave. In this project, we build a basic model to predict customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to model customers who have left, with Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib` for visualizations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset**. It contains information about customer demographics, account information, and services they subscribe to. The target variable is whether or not the customer has churned (left the company).

## Steps Involved in the Project

### 1. Importing Libraries
- We begin by importing necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and machine learning libraries from `sklearn`.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
- The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further exploration and preprocessing.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations and statistical analyses are performed to understand the distribution of the data, relationships between features, and the overall churn rate.

### 4. Outliers Detection using IQR Method
- Outliers in numerical columns are detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and handle anomalies in the data.

### 5. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Handling missing values, correcting data types, and making sure the data is ready for modeling.

### 6. One-hot Encoding
- Categorical variables are transformed into numerical format using one-hot encoding, which is essential for most machine learning algorithms.

### 7. Rearranging Columns
- The dataset columns are rearranged as necessary, typically placing the target variable (churn) at the end or beginning for clarity.

### 8. Feature Scaling
- Numerical features are scaled using methods such as `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which improves model performance.

### 9. Feature Selection
- Key features that contribute the most to the target variable (churn) are selected based on feature importance metrics or statistical tests.

### 10. Model Building
- We apply the following classification algorithms to predict customer churn:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**

### 11. Model Evaluation
- Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques may also be applied to ensure the robustness of the models.

## Conclusion

This project provides an introductory look at predicting customer churn using machine learning. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them and reduce churn. Further exploration could involve the use of advanced algorithms such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV.

## Future Work
- Experiment with additional models like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **XGBoost**.
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Explore **Feature Engineering** to create new features that could improve model performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating visualizations.
